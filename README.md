While BlockMesh has yet to secure investment, it is already forging significant partnerships with projects like Backpack and Eclipse. This ambitious collaboration highlights the project’s future potential and its ability to gain traction in the decentralized ecosystem.

## Early Opportunities and Rewards for Participants

Currently, BlockMesh offers an early participation phase that provides opportunities for users to engage with the project and earn rewards. This phase includes two main activities:

1.**Installing a browser extension:** A lightweight, user-friendly tool that integrates with BlockMesh’s decentralized communication platform.

2.**Running a node:** Participants can install a BlockMesh node on a server with minimal specifications. This straightforward setup not only contributes to the network’s decentralization but also allows users to earn points for their involvement.

## Installing a browser extension

First of all we will need one of the wallets: Backpack, Solflare or Phantom.
Go to the [BlockMesh website](https://app.blockmesh.xyz/register?invite_code=nodemafia) and register via your e-mail. After registration, confirm your email by checking your mailbox.

Next, connect our wallet and Twitter account. To connect Twitter, we need to subscribe to the [official BlockMesh account](https://x.com/blockmesh_xyz).

For all of this, BlockMesh Site > Perks > Connect Wallet or Connect Twitter.

After successfully connecting Perks, we can proceed to install the browser extension. Follow the link to [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blockmesh-network/obfhoiefijlolgdmphcekifedagnkfjp) and download the extension. Log in to your account. Browser Node is installed.

You can track your activity [here](https://app.blockmesh.xyz/ui/dashboard).

## Running a node on Linux
For a successful launch, we need to register on the [BlockMesh website](https://app.blockmesh.xyz/register?invite_code=nodemafia). Confirm your email and remember your password.

**System requirements:** 1CPU/1RAM/5SSD — minimal and Ubuntu 22.04.

You can run a quick installation using our installer(script). Just paste the link into the command line and press Enter.

```
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvorakkk/BlockMeshGuide/refs/heads/main/BlockMesh.sh && chmod +x BlockMesh.sh && ./BlockMesh.sh
```
Login is by your email and password. The script also allows you to track node logs and delete a node. You can track your activity [here](https://app.blockmesh.xyz/ui/dashboard).

## Conclusion.Why this project is unique.

BlockMesh is positioning itself as a promising open-source network designed for secure, decentralized oversight of AI systems. While still in its early stages without formal investment, the project has already gained momentum through key partnerships with **Backpack** and **Eclipse**, signaling its potential to become a significant player in the decentralized ecosystem.

BlockMesh provides early participants with valuable opportunities to engage through two key activities: **installing a browser extension** and **running a node on a server**. These activities not only contribute to the network’s decentralization but also offer participants rewards in the form of points, making it accessible and rewarding to be involved at an early stage.
